# AI Project: Bright Flash Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for an AI project focused on detecting bright flashes in images. The goal is to identify instances of explosions, fires, or cloudy smoke in photos. OR THE REVERSE COULD BE TRUE :)

## Project Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks for different stages of the project, including data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Placeholder for the dataset. You can organize your dataset here or provide instructions on how to obtain it.
- **`models/`**: Saved models after training. Include instructions on how to load and use the models.
- **`scripts/`**: Additional scripts or utilities used in the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries (install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`):

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/StephanFWard/AIProject.git
  cd AIProject

  Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

  Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  Open JupyterLab:

  Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and run the Jupyter Notebooks in sequence.

  Model Deployment
  For deploying the trained model, we recommend using TensorFlow Serving. Follow the steps in the deployment guide for detailed instructions.

  *Image training library not included in repo.
